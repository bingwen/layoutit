1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,567
Tangible problems.

2
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:05,719
I always felt from as long as I can 
remember about the power of science,

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:09,242
that it could be used to solve pressing issues, 
solve problems.

4
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:12,837
When I studied Chemistry at Princeton it was so theoretical, unapplied.

5
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:16,055
And I thought oh ok, maybe if I go into physics it will get better.

6
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:18,882
So I did, and was grossly disappointed.

7
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:24,222
We were studying wave propagation, and I couldn't
understand this one problem, this one equation.

8
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:28,613
So I went to the professor and I said whats this about,
where does this exist?

9
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:31,733
And he said well it actually doesn't exist, I just made it up.

10
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:34,996
It's like, oh ok, so that's what we do here.

11
00:00:34,996 --> 00:00:38,981
That was one of those turning points where I said,
wow what am I doing here?

12
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:43,484
In an absolute abundance of resources, power,

13
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:46,132
human development and culture and everything,

14
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:51,497
still there's many issues. Mainly the resource conflicts.
Poverty, war, depravation.

15
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:56,212
Survival with the awesome technology that we do have today?

16
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:59,011
Survival should not take a lot of time.

17
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:04,722
When you really think about it, all the wealth that we enjoy today for a modern standard of living

18
00:01:04,722 --> 00:01:10,307
relies on rocks, soil, sunlight, plants, water.

19
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:11,935
Those are all abundant.

20
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:17,136
Yet the productive mechanism of society is what makes it scarce, artificially so.

21
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:23,304
What if we could survive and thrive up to a modern standard of living,

22
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:28,286
and not only that, at two hours a day of work, and from local resources.

23
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:29,942
How would that be?

24
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:33,296
The most important part of Open Source Ecology is this idea that

25
00:01:33,296 --> 00:01:36,793
with a small amount of resources and a small amount of money,

26
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:42,193
anybody should be able to create a high standard of living for themselves,

27
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:46,211
and do it in a way that doesn't require a whole lot of time, a whole lot of money.

28
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:50,116
People can actually be empowered by the technology we're creating here,

29
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:54,487
so rather than a big corporation deciding what machines can do for us,

30
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:58,269
we can decide how we want machines to work for us.

31
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:01,981
Instead of relying on other people to make things that we need,

32
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:04,546
we can make everything that we need for ourselves.

33
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:07,220
And we can do it better than Walmart can do it,

34
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,972
we can do it better than slave labour in China can do it.

35
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:15,318
We can make the productive capacity that we need to live the lives that we want

36
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,103
in our own back yards, and we can do it in a sustainable way.

37
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:22,974
We can make machines that we can use to create material abundance for ourselves,

38
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:26,121
and then we can show other people how to do it.

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,195
If you have two-hundred people get together

40
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:32,184
and if they want to put together a self-sustaining community,

41
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:38,116
they don't have many options as far as coming up with the equipment and machines for doing that.

42
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,768
That's where Open Source Ecology really comes in.

43
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:47,861
The costs of building these machines is about ten percent of what you would buy it for commercially.

44
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:51,163
If you take a full blown John Deere tractor,

45
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:55,313
it's almost impossible for anyone to go out and try to build one of those for themselves.

46
00:02:55,313 --> 00:02:57,712
I mean that's just a very custom machine.

47
00:02:57,712 --> 00:03:02,387
But if you're able to take off-the-shelf engines and

48
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:07,252
go down to your hardware store and buy steel and build it yourself, like the Lifetrac,

49
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:10,057
then that's much more realistic.

50
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,929
The benefits of a localized economy are that

51
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,361
the power stays within the community, the economic wealth.

52
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,778
Instead of your money, the earnings, going all the way down the river,

53
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,834
what if we can internalise that?

54
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,015
Keep that wealth in,

55
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:24,859
by having all that productive mechanism built in.

56
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:28,508
You produce the same, the wealth stays in, you don't have to work so hard.

57
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:33,231
Then you can have time for you family and kids, or whatever else is more important to you.

58
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:43,220
So it's a lot easier productionwise to just have one super compatible module.

59
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,616
The Powercube right now works with both the Lifetrac and the CEB Press,

60
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:51,576
and a few other machines we have, like the Ironworker and the Coldsaw.

61
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:57,612
So that provides a much simpler product ecology

62
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,851
because one power unit serves multiple machines.

63
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:07,514
There is one thing about just being able to look at machines that have been developed on site here,

64
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:12,713
and another thing to understand how the development process went through and

65
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:15,777
what kind of documentation there is for these machines,

66
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:19,109
such that can be replicated and improved on.

67
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:25,593
Fortunately we have that ability to have machine information in the digital format,

68
00:04:25,593 --> 00:04:29,982
and now we have telecom, the Internet, to relay that information and

69
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:33,056
have anyone just copy over the files,

70
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:36,782
and have access to the model on their computer.

71
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:39,947
So Open Source Ecology tries to capture the open source nature of development and the fact

72
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:45,091
that we're connected to Nature, to other people, to societal institutions.

73
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:49,298
That all has to be considered if we're talking about a paradigm to make a better world.

74
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:56,262
Open source was clearly the emerging trend that was so powerful.

75
00:04:56,262 --> 00:05:00,170
Demonstrated with open source software like the Linux platform.

76
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,809
When a sufficient number of people come together on a project,

77
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:05,303
that project simply becomes better than anything else.

78
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:08,821
So we're transitioning that into the hardware space.

79
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:13,063
What would happen if people actually collaborated on making open source hardware?

80
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,514
We have lots of technology out there.

81
00:05:15,514 --> 00:05:19,331
But to organise the technology in such a way that it's accessible,

82
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:23,736
without barriers to people, that is a very significant move forward.

83
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:28,636
Now it's there for the individuals to organise themselves,

84
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:34,523
and to really dig deeply, almost to what you would say a spiritual level.

85
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:39,331
To really change their attitudes, and to take advantage of what is there,

86
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:43,116
and to move our civilisation forward.

87
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:47,002
I'm hopeful that human kind will arise to the occasion and

88
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:51,119
seize the opportunity offered by this development.

89
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:56,607
Open Source Ecology is really about creating the next economy: the open source economy.

90
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01,674
And what does that mean? It's an economy that optimises not only production,

91
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:04,312
which the present economy is really good at,

92
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:07,609
it's effective in production, but distribution is not so great.

93
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:10,939
And how do you do that? And that is by opening...

94
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:15,031
so called giving away trade secrets for free, or

95
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:19,183
developing open source products for just about anything that we use.

96
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:24,680
So imagine a scenario where instead of corporations all competing, reinventing the wheel and so forth,

97
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,768
a lot of competitive waste, what if everyone were to join together to make the best products,

98
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:33,421
the most robust products, that are open source, that anyone has access to producing them.

99
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:35,822
And therefore we can run an economy in a collaborative way,

100
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:39,109
as opposed to a competitive wasteful way.
