Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So a couple of weeks ago I asked a question

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,050
here on Smarter Every Day in hopes that it would be beamed up to the space station so the

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,080
astronauts could answer. Well that happened.
- Why don't we take the next question on YouTube.

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:16,129
I'm Destin from Huntsville Alabama. This is Sadie and Spotsy.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,149
On the International Space Station, if you're free falling in one position, without touching anything,

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,230
with no spin, is it possible to wiggle in such a way that you're able to rotate

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,250
to a different angular position and then stop? On Smarter Every Day we

8
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:32,269
demonstrated this with a high speed camera and a cat, who is a non holonomic system and

9
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:36,289
can do this by extending his legs, arching his back and twisting in a very specific pattern.

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,329
So can humans do this on orbit? You want to say hey to the astronauts?
- Hey.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,350
- Thank you. We look up to you guys.
- OK well that's a great question.

12
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:48,409
We don't have any cats on board, but we have a medical doctor

13
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:52,439
who maybe can try to demonstrate, the next best thing to a cat.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,490
So he's gonna try to demonstrate for you. Yes indeed you can, you can do this. So he's gonna get out

15
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:00,519
here and stop himself in open space, and he's gonna show you how he can turn himself

16
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,539
around. So he can't change his angular momentum but he can

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,549
change his body position and move himself to an orientation. So, I hope you

18
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:12,569
believe that what you saw happen with the cat isn't a mystery

19
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,600
and that it can happen in space too. Great question.
- So needless to say

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,620
I'm very excited about how this went down. Sadie has one more question by the way. What's your question?

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,650
- Why do you not have a cat on board?
[laugh]

22
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,689
So one day I hope to do research on the international space station myself.

23
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,729
So I thought it'd be pretty cool if I took a time hack and figured out exactly where the guys were when we

24
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,760
were talking. Turns out when they started listening to my question they were over the top of

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,780
Ecuador, and in the 70 seconds that we talked, they buzzed across the

26
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,849
equator, over Peru, which is cool because I spent a lot of time in Peru, and

27
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,859
into Columbia. I also thought it was pretty cool that after they answered the question you could see

28
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,909
Chris Hadfield over to the side. You can see the gears turning in his head, and I think

29
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,940
when the camera started flipping off he started doing a little test himself. He thinks

30
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,959
like me. He wants to figure things out. Which is good, to have people like that on the space station.

31
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,000
You heard me say that I look up to you. But I'm not trying to be funny or anything

32
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:09,030
like that. I actually do watch the International Space Station pass over my house. The tool I

33
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,080
use is heavens-above.com. You can go and you can enter where

34
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,099
your house is, and it'll tell you the next times that the ISS is gonna pass overhead.

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,110
It's really awesome. Even tells you where to look. Anyway, so I recommend going to do that.

36
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,139
But, warning, if you do that you're gonna have to turn your computer off and walk outside the house

37
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,159
and actually observe some real science, so maybe you should do that.

38
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,180
So I'd like to leave you with this. You are bound on the earth like I am, but

39
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,229
there is a human, that is ambassador for you in a weightless environment up on the International

40
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,250
Space Station, and he tweets every day. All you have to do is follow these

41
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,260
guys. They're up there. They're gonna pipe down pictures that they take every day and they're

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,270
really interesting. All you have to do is not be lazy and go look at what they're doing.

43
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:53,289
It's really cool. Also you should follow NASA. They have good stuff every day.

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,330
For some reason if you want to follow a less interesting guy, I'm right here. Feel free to look at my stuff

45
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:01,379
as well. Anyway I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. That was awesome.

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,430
Have a good one.
